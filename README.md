### **ICH Light Microscopy Facility Macro tools**

    **Scalebars Macros:**

* ICH_Scalebars_Mag_anywhere_in_Filename_v4.ijm  

* ICH_scalebars_Mag_from_folder_v5.ijm

    These set the scale and optionally adds scalebars to files with the magnification written anywhere_in_Filename (i.e 5x, 10x, 2.5x, recognises any format x10, 10x, 10X, X10, as long as no spaces between number and x). 

    Alternatively, run the Mag_from_folder version for files grouped into folder by magnification used.

    Calibrated for ICH Imaging facility microscopes only.

    **Colour image Zeiss CZI Macros:**

* CZItoRGB.ijm
* CZIroRGBFolder.ijm

    These macros correct the gamma display in Zeiss CZI files taken with a colour camera. The first macro corrects a single open file (you can save the output as a tif), the second macro will run through a folder of CZI files.
    
     **Combine 3 individual images into a 3 colour composite image:**

 * 3ChCompfromFilenamev003.ijm 

    This macro works on a folder of images, where you have taken 3 individually saved images, and combines them into a single 3 channel composite image. 
    For example, a folder with the following files:
    
    `ControlDapi-a1.tif, Control488-a1.tif, Control594-a1.tif,`
    
     `DrugDapi-b1.tif, Drug488-b1.tif, Drug594-b1.tif`
    
    Will be proceseds to give 2 new files in a new folder:
    
    `Control-a1-composite.tif, Drug-b1-composite.tif`
    
    By filling in the pop up box:
    
    ![3chPopUp](/Images/3chPopup.JPG)
    
    The save filename is generated from Ch1 filename, with the unique identifier removed, and '-Composite' appended.
    the appended text can be modified by changing the text in the macro line 86.

### **Published Macros**

[Cilia_Lengths_2D.ijm](https://github.com/DaleMoulding/Fiji-Macros/blob/master/Cilia_Lengths_2D.ijm) & [Cilia_Spots_2D.ijm](https://github.com/DaleMoulding/Fiji-Macros/blob/master/Cilia_Spots_2D.ijm) were published in:

* Taschner M, Lorentzen A, Mour√£o A, Collins T, Freke GM, Moulding D, Basquin J, Jenkins D, Lorentzen E. *Crystal structure of intraflagellar transport protein 80 reveals a homo-dimer required for ciliogenesis.* Elife. 2018 Apr 16;7. pii: e33067. PMID: [29658880](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29658880)

    **Cilia_Lengths** simply thresholds, skeletonizes and measures the length of cilia.

    **Cilia_Spots** additionally makes a ROI around each cilia, and counts the number of punctae (here IFT80) on each cilia, their density and spacing.
