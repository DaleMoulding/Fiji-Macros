Cilia_Lengths_2D.ijm & Cilia_Spots_2D.ijm were used in:

Taschner M, Lorentzen A, Mour√£o A, Collins T, Freke GM, Moulding D, Basquin J, Jenkins D, Lorentzen E. *Crystal structure of intraflagellar transport protein 80 reveals a homo-dimer required for ciliogenesis.* Elife. 2018 Apr 16;7. pii: e33067. PMID: [29658880](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29658880)

Cilia_Lengths simply thresholds, skeletonizes and measures the length of cilia.

Cilia_Spots additionally makes a ROI around each cilia, and counts the number of punctae (here IFT80) on each cilia, their density and spacing.
